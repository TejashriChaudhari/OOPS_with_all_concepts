    "super() returns a temporary object of the superclass that then allows you to call that superclass’s methods. The primary use case of super() is to extend the functionality of the inherited method.\n",

    "We have discussed earlier that in the case of method overriding, the previous method could not be called, but super makes an exception, and thus we can partially or completely use the method of the parent class too. We can even use super() to call only a specific variable we used in our overridden method. Calling the superclass-built methods with super() saves us from rewriting those methods in our subclass and allows us to swap out superclasses with minimal code changes."
